you for coming hello hello we are gonna have to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in like ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for comingum its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that uh i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat like shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating throughand then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find outum i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books like fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like you never know when you might need this and i was like but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of successi grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was like oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had we had so much chemistry he was like hey wassup i was like wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like hey can you drop me off i was like where he was like at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like oh no i just fucked a homeless dude againmy husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude you know you feel like youre in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and its very you know its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement you know just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im like i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer you knowbut i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on you knowmy last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its like making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre like i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes fromi think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was like its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abusedi grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats like a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were like oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the househim and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre like im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always like oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i waspeople are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013 like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be like we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre like but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn ita lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be like look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im like that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retiredi do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day like youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre like oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they wantyou know its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was like you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit togethermy fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was like why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just lets redecoratei gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to youi broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like uh youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really you know freaked out about anal and theyre like oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel like youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like oh my god its like im going back in time\\u266a a whole new world \\u266ait was magicala big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye like hes discovered nirvana and its like youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you knowmy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right you know i respect you right im like yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control you know like i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live you know i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do itsheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cuntim just waiting for the right moment to like become a housewife financially you know i want my husband to get us to like a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when you know youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple you know what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking like a princessi have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteranso i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be like guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was like yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won you knowanother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was like yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and you know why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were like yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im like oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here you knowi need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre like im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevityi also decided to have a kid because uh im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me like im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbustersi dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmdwhen my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release the kraken and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um yeah and most of the time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be like ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymoreim very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was like no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was like yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wantedim scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on the table i was like yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channeli can already see how theres like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommyyou know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing itnow that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporinso you know i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnantall right ive been ali wong have a good night

okay were having a good time andthank you thank you i like to tell people were having a good time you know i dont like to ask lot of comics come out here they go are we having a good time not me i cant risk it you know what i mean and yes i will do that joke the rest of my life and uh  its my favorite joke i love it its not even a joke so much just it is the truth that we are having a good time i used to work at a restaurant called western sizzlin i dont know if you know that one buffetstyle restaurant with a smoking section you know what i mean eat more than you can breathe in therei love a smoking section i like smoking inside reminds me of my childhood you know sleeping on the top bunk of a single wide trailer thats where all the smoke is up there  i go to school the next day smelling like smoke wearing a nascar tshirt when i was growing up my mom was a big nascar fan and she liked the driver alan kulwicki i dont know if you guys remember him but he drove the hooters car i was the only third grade kid with a tshirt that said hooters on the front and more than a mouthful on the back  they didnt mean to send me home they were like he aint got no better shirts  leave in a hooters shirt come back in a marlboro shirt still got a little pack of cigarettes in the pocket where i switched out with my dad in the parking lot  i love smoking smokings the best um yeah everybodys quitting now i think its a shame  its hard to smoke anywhere anymore tough to light up a cigarette out here some of these cities you cant even smoke i caught a whiff of some secondhand in a walmart parking lot the other day there wasnt even nobody smoking out there thats just where the smoke goes now  thats the only place it feels welcome  i worked at western sizzlin two times i remember working there one day and this guy was refilling the buffet and he was working real hard and as he was pouring green beans into the buffet he was pouring sweat into the green beans  yeah very salty its  some would argue too much salt really i stopped doing that joke for a while because it was grossing everybody out i like to bring it back once in a while just kind of see where were at as a society i like that were still grossed out by it i think thats a good sign western sizzlin and if you dont know its like a golden corral you know without all the class like alike a silver corralor like a bronze corral you know like an ok corral you know what i mean  doing all right in there i liked working there i learned a lot thats where i smoked cigarettes without using my hands  cause they wouldnt give us real smoke breaks we could only smoke while we were rolling silverware  but you need both hands to roll silverware so wed just go back there and light up and get to rollin got smoke all in our eyes customers would be like theres ashes in this silverware im like you should see whats in your green beansi mean this   i wouldnt worry about those ashes ill tell you that you can just blow those off theres stuff in here you cant just blow off like that i used to sell pesticides for a living i dont know if you can tell that by looking at me buti did that for a long time i sold pesticides to lowes and home depot i did that for a long time people would come in and ask weird questions theyd be like im looking for something organic id like to kill the insects but not harm the environment im like well how about a shoe  cause im selling pesticides here andthat stuff is poison all right im hurting stuff out here i liked that job because i worked in the store but not for the store i had a bunch of different stores that i went to my boss was never around i had a lot of freedoms but i had my shirt tucked in so people thought i worked there they would ask me to help them find stuff and i would unless they got an attitude then like midhelp id be like i dont know  i dont work here  then id just walk off you know customers dont know what to do with something like that they get the manager the managers like i dont know he doesnt work here and they cant find me because i already untucked my shirt  i disappeared right there in the storetheyre pointing at me is that him theyre like kind of looks like him but the guy im talking about works here  im gone im already out front smoking  im out there trying to calm down you ever see people try to calm down with a cigarette hitting it all hard got paper burning all fast they got a cherry on it that long theyre like im trying to calm down im like i dont think its working  you might just need some regular breaths   it could be oxygen youre looking for i dont know   i used to work with a guy he hit cigarettes so hard you could hear it leaving his lips and hed be like i was like dang dude take it easy  i felt sorry for the cigarettes  i was like i know theyre killing you but they dont deserve that  they say cigarettes will kill you but i dont know you know what i mean i saw a bunch of old people out front of this restaurant smoking the other day i was like thats proof right there it dont kill ya like they didnt look good  but they were alive yeah smokings the best i did quit but it is the best though i quit when i quit drinking i used to be a big drinker i love drinking drinkings the best too i think i was a really good drinker a lot of my friends disagreed um most of them in fact i was the type of drinker you could make eye contact with at some point in the night and look deep into my eyes and know that i couldnt see you  like the spirit had left the body  just floating around out here looking for a waffle house  cracker barrel something like that just trying to eat my way back into sobriety still got a little bit to get home i love cracker barrel though cracker barrels fun a lot of good food in there chicken and dumplings you can get dumplings as a side you can get chicken and dumplings and dumplings in there you cant do that at a lot of places i like cracker barrel they had a lot of billboards in the south they were all over in the interstate and i like most of them but one billboard said this it said biscuits are like spoons you can eat right cause thats not true right  a biscuit aint nothin like a spoon yeah you can eat it but that dont make it like a spoon the reason i didnt like it is i felt like these billboards were only in the south and i didnt want people not from the south driving through here think were down here trying to eat spoons   you know what i mean  cause were not down here trying to eat spoons  i told this joke down in kentucky one time this girl goes thats true you can dip your biscuit into whatever youre eating let it soak up and then put that biscuit in your mouth im like yeah thats how you use a biscuit  thats not how you use a spoonive never seen a spoon that can soak stuff up you know thats tough to clean man just saying you cant go around replacing biscuits with spoons and spoons with biscuits i mean nobody is born with a silver biscuit in their mouth  nobody in the mountains now is playing the biscuits  thered be crumbs everywhere nobodys melting heroin down on a biscuit  actually i dont know if thats true or not ive not done a lot of heroin

like you know that stuffs addictive im like yeah i was here yesterdaystarting to pick up a pattern here i pawned my grandmothers necklace to get this money so lets move this along here that was a dare video they showed in high school they showed me a video of a girl doing cocaine one time the next thing shes pawning all of grandmas jewelry to get more drugs and that video worked for me because im like man i better stay away from this stuff cause my grandmother aint got nothin but afghans  i dont know how much drugs you can get for an afghan i dont know the street value of a crocheted item   id be hitting up my grandma every day let me get another of them afghans from you shes just crocheting away  shes like you love these things eh i got to give her some of the drugs just to keep her goingnow we both got a problem i love dippin though i was big into dippin its a lot of fun i love to dip and drive i have five or ten beers get behind the wheel put a dip in im smoking because i forgot im dippin   i used to wear contacts back in the day i was a different guy back then uh im not always the best about washing my hands i know thats gross i get it but matter of fact i hate washing my hands  to be honest with you i know thats not popular to say these days and honestly its never really been that popular to say  but i hate it i like to compliment peoples bathrooms soaps so they think i wash my handsi hate when im in a public restroom and somebody else comes in cause im like dang now i got to wash my hands sometimes they come right in go into the stall ill just cut some water on for a minute maybe let out some paper towels i spend more time faking it then i would just washing my hands  its tough to fake it now though lot of these bathrooms got motion sensors in there you stand over the sink doing like this you mess around you get your hands wet  dang i might as well do the whole thing now i miss the old days where they had that hand dryer that you can just punch it and it starts blowing you get right out of there people think im drying my hands im already out in the gas station touching stuff  getting a donut with the tongs  selfserve coffee struggling with the lids aw touched so many   getting a hot dog then being like nah i dont want a hot dogjust put it back on the roller   nowadays the hand dryers they got a lot of hand dryers that you got to like dip it in there i dont know if youve seen those bunch of grown men just dippin it   just waiting in line to dip it  some got a little thin strip in there you got to try to avoid touching like a game of operation in there  the soap they give you now they dont even give you real soap they just give you foam in there its like used soap its like soap that somebody else has already worked into a lather i dont know about you but i kind of like to work my own lather thats not a service im looking for  they say they give you the foam to conserve soap i had no idea we were dealing with a soap crisis so i like to do my part by just not using any at all   my cups heavy yeah okayit is a heavy cup were having a good time and uh oh right so i love dippin one day im at home im dippin i put in a dip im having a great day loving life i realize im late for work and im like oh no i got to put my contacts in i forget to wash my hands well i dont forget i just dont do it i didnt do like this good enough so i run over there i throw in my contacts i got dip all over my fingers i get in the car and im just getting blasted in the eyes with dip you know and its a good buzz  if you can handle it it is very painful but youre also very calm cause youve got a lot of nicotine in your system in the cheek and the eyelids borderline an overload here i showed up to work that day my eyes were all red its tough to convince your boss youre not high if you show up with eyes that red my boss was like you high today i was like nah i was at home and i was dippin i forgot to wash my hands and i put my contacts in he goes so youre high then  i was like well yeah im high thats not why my eyes are red but im high of course im high i work at a restauranti didnt want to do the drugs im just trying to fit in with my peers  everybody at a restaurants high if youre ever in a restaurant and youre like wheres my server theyre in the walkin cooler getting high  or in the weight station eating off your plate thats what i liked to do i liked to eat off peoples plates after they were done with it  which is less gross for you more gross for me i wont disrespect the customer but i will disrespect my own body i was doing it a lot i loved doing it i think it was grossing out some of my coworkers so i had to come up with a system a way to justify it to them and maybe to myself a little bit and i decided i would only eat off the plates of women and only if i would make out with them cause i feel if youll make out with somebody its okay to eat their food if you give that any moment of thought youll realize its a pretty good system but then there was a lot of food coming to the back that i wanted to eat off the plates of guys so i had to ask myself would the girl that i would make out with make out with this guy  i found the answer is always yes i figure if shell make out with me shell make out with anybody and i like crab cakes you know what i mean were having a good time  you guys are very nice what a great crowd thats true though when i say something sincere and laugh it doesnt seem sincere and i dont mean it that way ive quit dippin now too ive given up a lot things i have a baby now so im trying to livei want to live now i wanted to live before but i didnt care if i died does that make sense i mean i wasnt sad but i was like i could die you know what i mean i was trying to get healthy a little bit so i went to the doctor and they gave me a questionnaire and one of the questions was how often do you sit down and i never really thought about that i was like dang thats pretty much what i do sometimes ill lay down i dont know if you count that so i dont sit all day i will lay down a little bit stretch out my back  the way i see it my life is just walking to new places to sit downi dont know how much standing im supposed to be doing out here so what i figure what i did i joined the gym and ill go in there walk around a bit touch on some stuff  you know what i mean grab a barbell and go dang that feels good ill lift this next week and uh then i hit the tanning bed and get right out of there i felt like if you look good you feel good who doesnt look good with a tan i got a lot of digestive issues i burp a lot and i know its gross but i do burp a lot thats why covid was tough on me i dont know if you burped into an  mask before it does not go away man thats the best mask i dont know if keeps stuff out but it keeps stuff in thats research ive done on my own i dont know if burp is thicker than virus or not but i almost choked out in a grocery store one time i burped into that thing had two straps on it got tangled up in my hair couldnt get it off my glasses were fogging up im about to pass out they were like you got covid im like no i got a burp in here why dont you pull out a pocket knife cut this thing off im trying to breathe a little bit im in here trying to get some grapes i get a lot of heartburn a lot of heartburn i got heartburn so bad i ruptured my appendix and i didnt even really know it i was just like dang this heartburns getting bad man im used to it being up around in here but now its down here it really feels about the same i walked around like that for months i finally went to the doctor and pushed around on my stomach and then they get down here and they sent me the hospital i get to the hospital and they do a full body scan on me the surgeon came back and he said it looks like a bomb went off where your appendix used to be that was his real words looks like a bomb went off where your appendix used to be everybody was saying it i heard it out in the hallway it looks like a bomb went off it was the talk of the hospital they couldnt stop saying it  everybody was saying it thats all i was hearing they found out i didnt have insurance and they were like well it wasnt a full rupturetheyre like get out of here man yeah you take these antibiotics and come back if it gets worse and it did get worse it did get worse so i had to go back to the hospital and they cut me open did all kinds of things to my body i dont know what they did but i know if they put you to sleep cut you open and you not wake up they can do whatever they want to you and i bet they did  you know what i mean  and i woke up after surgery and they had me on an iv drip of ketamine i dont know if youve done ketamine before one person does cause if if youve done it you cant contain yourself after somebody brings it up for everybody else the best way i can describe ketamine is if i had two appendixes id try to rupture that other one just so i could do ketamine one more time cause that was honestly a lot of fun i could close my eyes and immediately go into a dream id open my eyes tell my wife all these things i saw there was a lot of things and shed be like your eyes were closed for  seconds i dont know what to tell you ive been doing some time travelling and theres some darkness coming thats all i can tell you  its getting dark i know people i bet i could get some ketamine if i started asking around but i dont really want to be doing ketamine at the house its fun to do drugs in the hospital you do some you start freaking out then they give you something to correct yourself you freak out with your friends theyre like get out before you ruin the whole party   were not driving you to the hospital tonight get out of here  you know what i mean okay  so i dont have an appendix now and uh they say you can live without it and i guess thats true but i could also live without my feet you know what i meani sure like having those thingswere having a good timei did a ted talk one time ive done a lot of unintentional ted talks but i did one on purpose if you dont know its where people stand on stage and talk and nobody laughs ive done it a few times unintentionally but one time i did a ted talk and it was a ted talk on were having a good time you know like the power of positive thinking no matter whats going on you say were having a good time and youll feel better very deep stuff  so i agreed to do it and then i ruptured my appendix im laying in the hospital like i dont know if i believe this anymore  you know but i had already agreed to it so i was like im gonna do it so i wrote out this great  min ted talk it was very good one of the best i bet and i gave myself two days to memorize it which is not enough time maybe for you not for me so i show up to the venue i get on the stage im up there for about two minutes and then i forget the rest of that ted talk so i forgot  of the  minutes and im just standing there and i just start doing jokesim like im not about to bomb this ted talk here so its very funny it just doesnt make a lot of sense one minute im talking about the power of positive thinking the next im talking about growing up in a trailer park making a lot of loose connections its on youtube dont watch it on the day were doing the ted talk theres several people doing ted talks one right after another and the girl who went on before me is talking a lot about pooping in a davids bridal right im sure it was very good i wasnt able to listen to the whole thing i was in the back trying to memorize my own ted talk but i just kept hearing her talk about pooping in a davids bridal something big went down that day thats all i know and when i go out im just trying to break the ice a little bit and im like hey i pooped in a lot of davids bridals  and when my ted talk came out they left that part inwith no context they have no idea that the girl before me talked a lot about pooping in a davids bridal you dont even know anyone went before me for all you know i was the one and only speaker that night it was my night to do a ted talk people bought tickets just to see my ted talk and i decided to open with hey i pooped in a lot of davids bridalsand then never mention it again i dont bring it back around at the end put a little bow on it and thats why i pooped in a lot of davids bridals  but a lot of people have seen it they keep watching that thing i wish they wouldnt but they keep watching it i dont know how long theyre watching it i dont dig into those metrics i dont like to see how long people are watching things one time i checked my website i wanted to see how long people are on my website for some reason i dont know why i wanted to know that i checked and it is a shockingly low amount of time it seems like every person who clicks on my website goes oh whoops  i dont know how i got here but must be a typo lets get out of here but my website is dustyslaycom and that makes sense cause thats my name but i opened this website with godaddycom years ago and i had some problems with it so i had to call godaddy im talking to him and i dont know if im talking to daddy or not but    they were reading off my website back to me and they go so its dustys laycom  im like well its not that kinda websitebut that may be the problem right people think theyre going to dustys laycom and they click on it and im like hey i pooped in a lot of davids bridals   and theyre like oh back back back back  clearing out the search history  i dont know  were having a good time  that laugh came out of nowhere didnt it  we didnt see that one coming i go out to the woods a lot and um  whoo lately ive been picking up a lot of ticks not like a nervous tick but like an insecti get ticks in weird places man i got a tick on a body part that rhymes with tick  thats not as fun as youd think itd be i got worried that i had lyme disease and i looked up some symptoms and one of the symptoms is youll be real tired i was like dang im tired  then i realized that ive been tired for a long time so if anything i gave that tick lyme disease  i may be the original carrier of lyme disease im sorry about that i knew i should have killed that tick just flush them down the toilet every time figure if they can live from that they deserve their life i used to play out in the woods a lot as a kid we werent afraid of ticks back then we were afraid of real stuff like snakes and bears my parents had me afraid of falling into an old well that was our big fear you fall into an old well people wont find you for three or four days im like three or four days how about if i dont come home tonightyou go looking for me like im not a world traveler out here you got a pretty good idea of where im gonna be maybe walk around out there listen for somebody going help help thatll be me trapped in an old well  its gotta be an old well though new well people just come by crank you right out of there old well people just come by throw change in there you make a little money down in an old well tough to spend it but you can make it down there people come try to rescue you theyre like youre too heavy drop all that change nah you come back with stronger people  i made this money down here im down here doing well you know what i mean  thank you thank you i grew up in alabama thats where im from andthank you thank you all right my dad still lives there my dad lives on a farm and he used to have this field where he had this big ditch where he used to throw a lot of trash and old appliances and paint cans and stuff like that hes a big environmentalist and uh that ditch was just full of stuff one day this guy came along and he wanted to dig around in that ditch my dad was like nah there aint anything worth digging around in there the guy was like nah man i love digging around in stuff like that so my dad was like all right if you love it you love it go dig around down there so the guy goes down there starts digging around in that ditch about a half hour later my dad hears this big explosion and he looks down there and can see that the ditch has blown up turns out what happened was the guy got way deep down in that ditch and it got real dark and he couldnt see he didnt have a flashlight so he pulled out a lighter apparently there was a lot of gas and fumes in there so when that guy struck that lighter that ditch just blew up with that guy inside    i was like dang was that guy okay my dad was like yeah he was a little disoriented but uhhe was okay then thats all he ever really said about it i dont know one time when i was a little kid i was about this old eight or so i dont know how old that is and uh  me and my dad we were cleaning out this swimming pool and my dad had a pool vacuum i had a little net were trying to clean it up and theres this bullfrog in the pool we want to catch it and set it free we want to save that frogs life so i jump in there try to catch it its too fast try to scoop it out with a net it keeps jumping out and my dad had this idea he thought the frog would be too big to get sucked up the pool vacuum so he thought he could just catch it like this then that frog just kind of ride the suction on up to the top then we take it off and set it free that was the dream  but it turns out that frog was not too big to get sucked up i dont know who saw that coming sucked up right away i remember seeing it come up the hose it was stretching it out all along the way real cartoonlike like a snake had eaten it and then when the frog got to the top it was all busted open and it had died thats not what we wanted to happen but the frog did die that day my dad also used to have this vhs camcorder and he used to film everything he filmed everything i found a tape labelled christmas and court  i was like dang the holidays took a turn huh you dont wanna just start a new tape i guess trying to keep it alphabetical im digging through these tapes he had a bunch of tapes and i find this one and start watching it i come across this video and its of me and my dad talking im still a little kid you know and were talking all about the frog day we get to the very end and then my dad goes and then it just hopped away and you could see my face change like knowing that my dad was lying but also not knowing how to correct my dad so im just like mmhmm so i guess what im trying to say is i think that guy died in that ditch that dayall right all right thats what i think happened there could be hundreds of bodies out there i dont know i dont know how long thats been going on  maybe thats why i love country music i dont know the connection but could be something there i do love country musicall right thats four people thats not bad a room this size you get four country fansthats what im talking about i love country country is the one genre of music people tell you they dont like even when you didnt ask youre like what kind of music you like everything but country oh everything huh big polka fan i guess  really into acid jazz  i cant wait to see you at that enya concert lateryou guys remember enya i was listening to enya a little bit early  i was living in a trailer for the second time i was doing some drugs you know what i mean getting paranoid in the daytime i tore up some miniblinds in there  whats going on out there im worse on blinds than a cat man i dont know how familiar you are with trailers but theyre narrow you can go side to side quick checking miniblinds from the couch to the love seat back to the couch whats going out there you ever been so paranoid inside in the daytime then you go outside and go actually its a pretty nice day out here  inside youre worried people are coming outside youre like i wish some people would come  i could use a friend but i love country ive been listening to this travis tritt song recently a song called the whiskey aint workin anymore i dont know if heard that song came out in the  real classic hit the whiskey aint workin anymoretwo three people good yeahall right there it is  that might be travis tritt i dont know     its called the whiskey aint working anymore it came out in the  classic song ive heard a million times the other day im listening i caught a lyric in there i had not heard before this is what he says he goes a woman warm and willing thats what im looking for  i was like dang those are some low standards right there i mean thats as low as it gets man warm and willing you know warm like alive or maybe has just died i dont know i dont know how long it takes a body to get cold i had a mortician at one of my shows she goes a lot longer than you think and i had not spent a lot of time thinking about it i dont think a mortician should be dealing with warm bodies if youre dealing with a warm body you got there too quick you know something like if i show up to the morgue and im warm i want you to give me a little shake cause ive slept hard before  make sure im dead dont be embalming a warm body you know thats something ive always said  theres another travis tritt song i like this ones called its a great day to be aliveits a great song it is a fun song one of my favorites but in that song he doesnt say its a great day to be alive until you get to the chorus and if you just listen to the first verse of that song you would not think thats what hes about to say  the song starts off with him going i got rice cookin in the microwave im not saying theres anything wrong with that but thats not really a start to a great day is it  if thats a great day what were you up to yesterday just sitting around eating dry rice dang this is not good if youre making a list of things that made your day great i dont think microwaveable rice makes the list little while later in the song he says hes making a homemade soup i got to question what kind of soup youre really making youre making a homemade soup but you cant boil a pot of ricei dont think so he talks about how good hes doing then he says neither drink nor drug induced that sounds like hes doing drugs  your friends that dont do drugs dont tell you theyre happy and then say im not doing drugs he says two times in the first verse im doing all right are you doing all right or is it a great day to be alive  cause those are not the same thing imagine youre at work and a coworker comes in and goes its a great day to be alive youre like dang how you doing today and theyre like ah im all rightyou know what i mean i love work small talk like that work small talk is my favorite i loved it i loved to walk into a lowes back in the day be like all right just living the dream another day another dollar workin hard or hardly workin those are my three favorites i like to rotate those throughout the day id go into this one lowes talk to the same guy every time every time hed do this id go how you doing today he goes if i was any better id be you id like to go well im not doing goodso im sorry to hear so im sorry to hear it i like small talk in general a lot of people say if you talk about the weather youve run out of things to talk about but i like to lead with weather weather is what i want to talk about like if i go outside and its real hot i have to say it out loud i cant just think it i have to go dang its hot even when im alone i have to say it then if i see anybody on the street ill try to make eye contact oh its hot out here huh and if theyre into it well talk about the weather for a while ill start telling them about weather of other places ive been its hot here but last week i was in michigan guess what it was cold  you believe that then i pull out my phone i show him a screenshot of the weather  ill hold it there until they acknowledge it sorry that locked up on you there  didnt realize i was holding it for two minutes  i was in phoenix one time it was  degrees i carried that screenshot around for about four years  anytime i told someone this story id go hold on hold on theyre like we believe you im like nah nah nahnah you got see it though yeah its in here somewhere ill find it theres a country song by george strait called the fireman he goes they call me the fireman thats my name well is that your name or that what they call you cause  if thats your name explains why they been calling you that they call me dusty thats my name theres another song i like by a band called lonestar this song is called im already there dont know if you heard that song before most dramatic country song of all timevery dramatic song guy leaves for the weekend you think hes going for the rest of his life if you havent heard the song its about a guy out working the road i dont think he says what hes doing i imagine its music and he misses his family cause hes on the road and i get that he says he calls his wife from a lonely cold hotel room which seems like a booking issue to me  its not hard to find a hotel with heat these days thats not even something they advertise anymore tough to find a hotel without heat to be honest with you you get a better hotel youll still be lonely but comfortable and hes talking to his wife hes crying i imagine and uh then he hears a little kid in the background his kids small and his kid gets on the phone and his kid goes dad when you coming home this is what he says to his kid he goes im already there i was like why are you doing that to the kid  that kids small man he doesnt get the poetry youre doing that kids probably like what youre homewhy are we doing this weird phone thing here lets get together lets spend some time together play catch or something mom said you were gone i dont know why she said that  then the dad goes says something like this im the sunshine in your hair son im the whisper in the wind im the shadow on the ground that kids probably like mom whats wrong with dad  what is he talking about maybe the songs darker than we realize you

the sunshine in your hairsee what the shadow on the grounds up to have a little chat with the whisper in the wind  ive talked to whisper in the wind before ill talk to anybody or anything i love talking lot of my friends i take a lot of ubers and a lot of my friends get mad if the uber driver talks to them too much its the opposite for me i think the uber driver gets mad at me for talking hes like you want to listen to the radio im like no turn it off  i only got five minutes alone with you in this car i got a lot of stuff i need to tell a stranger okay ive got a lot of conspiracies i need to get off of my chest honestly my wife is tired of hearing it so im not even ubering anywhere im just im just ubering to talk man i love the car i like being in the car i like driving travelling you ever get a fly in your car and that flys in there for a while youve been driving down the road driving for miles that flys all over the place in there youve been going for miles all of a sudden you let that fly out what do you think its like for that fly like that fly is way away from home now thatd be like going into a grocery store and coming out in arkansas  dang what happened while i was in there that flys got to start a whole new life now you ever do enough drugs to think of something like thatall right lot of drug addicts here tonight i appreciate it but you dont even need drugs now weed is so strong now weed is like drugs you know what i mean i dont know what happened to weed weed used to be a good old fun recreational activity but now its like hard drugs man ive done weaker acid than the weed thats out here now whoo its true i used to have a lot of fun with weed when i was younger i could smoke a joint or a blunt with some people we laugh have a good time listen to some music now i take one hit and im walking around in the yard praying  i feel like im having a heart attack im just saying over and over again weeds never killed anyone weeds never killed anyone i dont even know if thats true that used to be true but i dont know if its true anymore guess weed could be killing people i dont know weed grew up got violent thats all i know  i grew up in alabama and weed used to be scary to get but fun to do now if you live in a state where its legal its like fun to get but scary to do when i was growing up if you wanted to get weed you gotta get   dollars together you go to a bad neighborhood some guy would come out youd give him the money he may come back with the weed he may not right its  really you never knew where itd be in itd be in a bag it might be in a coffee filter one guy brought me weed right out of his hand one time i was like im not sure you weighed this  if you dont have money for bags you dont have money for scales you might want to think about investing in your business here youre looking to do this long term that is you got the weed it was fun easy light weed you know nowadays if you live in a state where its legal buying weed is like a shopping experience you go into a store its all well lit its like a best buy or an att store in there sometimes the cops are there but to protect the drug dealers some of these stores are set up like a pharmacy everybody insides a little scientist theyre telling you about all the different strands of weed one lady was like this weed is creative and uplifting i was like oh okay well thats not what im looking for i was like i dont really know what that means to be honest with you im not looking to spend time with the weed not trying to hear the weeds ideas on things they think im weird because im always like whats the weakest weed you have here like you got any weed you were thinking about throwing out you got any weed people returned because it wasnt working good thats the kind of weed im looking for im just trying to enjoy some tv out here you know im not trying to disappear into a different realm im not trying to sleep with a light on all night in my hotel room cause the darkness is too thick   ever do that though you get high and youre like its been a great day had a lot of fun but now its time for bed you turn the light switch off and it feels like nighttime lays down on you im like well thats coming back onand the tv and the podcast i may call a friend make sure im still alive  i freaked out in a lot of hotel rooms nobody knows its happening but it is ill hear a noise out in the hallway i think people are coming to get me i look out the peephole its just some family enjoying their life no idea about the darkness going on in my hotel room  over one hit of weed you think id been in there doing heroin all week im all strung out i got biscuits everywhere   sometimes ill smoke weed in the hotel room and thats always a mistake for me ill take one little puff i think ive smoked the whole hotel out its made its way down to the front desk theyre calling the police the police are on their way im out in the parking lot like im not even at this hotelmatter of fact right now im loitering i better leave before i get in trouble for loitering cause im not at this hotel thats something i can tell you right now so when i do smoke in the hotel i like to take it very seriously i go into the room i put the do not disturb sign on the door then i go into the bathroom and put another do not disturb sign on the door  so if they come through the first door theyll be like this is a lot more private than we realized we shouldnt have come through the first one but its definitely against hotel policy to go through two do not disturb signs then i put a little towel under the door i take a little hit blow it into the toilet close the lid flush it   thats what i do every time i dont know if it works or not but ive not been kicked out of a hotel yet so either it works or nobody cares smokes gotta hit the water by the time that spirals kickin in  sucks it right down i like to think im doing a service i like to think theres somebody on the other end of that toilet working down in a sewer somewhere hangin out with a bunch of ninja turtles  fighting off all the ticks im flushing  that smoke hits him in the face hes like all right i appreciate that pleasant smell for a change great day to be alive down hereyou know what i mean thats true  my wife doesnt do drugs and i always think everythings weird when im high and thats how she knows like if i start saying stuffs weird she knows whats going on we go to a coffee shop the other day and we come out and i go that was weird in there huh she was like nah that was the most normal coffee shop experience we could have had you went in you asked for coffee they gave it to you you paid for it now were outside  what was weird i was like i dont know but there was a vibe in there  felt like they didnt want us in there but it was a real hipster coffee shop real hip and if it gets too hip they dont want you in there they dont want me in there i know that theyre very rude to me in there but i like a rude coffee shop i like to be treated bad while im trying to order a coffee i like to be berated i feel like the ruder the coffee shop employee the better the coffee i dont know why that is but it seems to be true every time if you go to a place and theyre real friendly youre like ah theres gonna be folgers in heregonna be in a styrofoam cup with a lid that dont fit that good could have made this at home  so i love a hipster coffee shop cause i like good coffee you know but sometimes they complicate things for no reason like all i drink is black coffee i went to this one coffee shop and i go up to the guy he figured out a way to complicate that i go up to him let me get a black coffee he goes pourover or drip i was like i dont know however you get it in there you know what i mean im like i dont really know what youre asking me right now im not looking to be involved in making the coffee here pour it drip it whatever you gotta do man but wrap it up he was like pourover takes  minutes i was like well start dripping then  i dont know how you drip faster than you pour man  that dont even make sense i dont know how or why youre doing it like that fifteen minutes to make a coffee i dont need it to be that good i like a good coffee but i dont need you back there massaging the beans fifteen minutes is enough to get to know a person im not trying to form a relationship with the barista here turns out a pourover coffee is when theyre making you your own individual cup of coffee so i guess youre taking up one employee in that coffee shop for the next  minutes cause you dont want your coffee mingled with the other coffee i dont need it to be that good i dont need a pourover coffee i have found a place that manages to be rude to you and give you bad coffee and that place is known as the waffle house you know what i mean i love the waffle house but im not going there for the coffee ill have it but im not going there for it i do love the waffle house i was selling pesticides with a guy from new jersey one time and he told me he had never been to the waffle house i was like all right lets go right now cause i didnt want to mess around and let somebody else take him cause i like taking people to the waffle house for the first time its a lot of fun for me to see the excitement on their face we walk in i wanted it to be a good experience cause he had never been we walk in and theres an older waitress in there and she goes welcome to waffle house i was like how you doing today she goes im tired and i could use a cigarette but people keep coming in here  i was like boom thats what im talking about  thats the kind of attitude im looking for in here i was excited i made eye contact with my friend im like you see whats going on in here this is how we do it at the waffle house we sat down and ate it was very good right after we ate a roach came from under the table ran up my shirt got about right here i swatted it down it hit the table disappeared i dont know what happened to it honestly i couldnt have paid for a better experience in there cause you want to see a roach once in a while in the waffle house just make sure theyre still keeping it organic in there not using a lot of pesticides in there you want to see it after you eat that way its like yeah im nauseous but im full  you know thank you and uh   whoo thank you thats okay i dontyeah okay were losing it and um  you know the best thing about having hair long like this is that if i find a hair in my food i just assume its mine i just lift it up like this i go yeah thats definitely one of mine i dont know how it got lodged deep down in that omelette definitely one of mine though good thing too or i would have lost my appetite i could eat my own hair you know what i mean its tough to eat hair you ever swallow about half a hair you cant get it down all the way  you got to dig it out its like fishing for throwup youre like ah ah ah   it is true im sorry i did that thats gross  one time i was doing comedy in arkansas i was leaving driving back to nashville and i wanted to get coffee on the way i was looking for a good coffee but i didnt know any places so i typed something into google and i pulled up to this place called cowgirls coffee i was like thats what im talking about i didnt know what cowgirls coffee was at the time but it seemed cool to me i was wearing cowboy boots that day im like i cant wait to walk into this place this is gonna be a great time and im with a couple of other comics and we pull up to this old warehouselooking building and im like is this a strip club and it was a strip clubcowgirls coffee was a little coffee booth in the parking lot of the strip club and they were affiliated this is not a coincidence so i told my friends lets just go somewhere else i dont know what strip club coffee tastes like never had it never been offered to me i never walked into a strip club and been you know what start me off with a coffee id like to get a real lay of the land here before we get down to business id like to be very alert throughout this experience i was like lets go somewhere else my friends were like were already here lets just pull up to the booth and see what they got i was all right but i dont want coffee here i want a good cup of coffee im not trying to get it from here we pull up to the booth and we can see inside and theres a girl in there wearing lingerie serving coffee and i was like well we could get a coffee  like coffee is coffee at the end of the day lets not make a big deal about it its not our last cup of coffee if we dont like it we can get another one down the road i was telling them dont judge the place you dont know what this place has been through here the girl was like what kind of coffee i was like pourover you know what i mean  all right thank you very much guys i appreciate youthank you very much you guys are greatyou guys are great thank you very much i appreciate

irregardless a  standup comedy special kevin james delivers a performance that expertly blends humor with insightful observations on everyday life he begins with a quirky musical number showcasing his singing talent and setting a lighthearted tone throughout the special james touches on a variety of relatable topics often with a selfdeprecating twistone central theme is the absurdity and humor found in aging and health james jokes about his own physical decline and the overmedicalization of modern life like being labeled prediabetic and the unnecessary fear this instills he also satirizes societal overcaution with a story about a woman labeled borderline anemic highlighting the tendency to exaggerate health concernsjames humorously addresses technology and its intrusiveness particularly through his mistrust of siri and the difficulty of deleting apps his take on modern parenting and childrearing resonates with many as he discusses removing video games from his children and the challenges of engaging them in physical activities this segues into a broader critique of contemporary parenting styles contrasting them with the stricter beltdriven discipline of previous generationsin a poignant turn james reflects on his own limitations in knowledge and conversation using the story of buster douglas to illustrate his narrow expertise he humorously recounts an awkward social encounter where his lack of knowledge is exposed leading to a comedic breakdown of his attempt to use complex vocabularyin his routine james humorously focuses on the dynamics of his marriage particularly highlighting the contrast between his wifes incessant talking and his own introspective nature he examines their differing communication styles with a blend of admiration and playful frustrationthe special concludes with a return to the musical theme bookending the performance and leaving the audience with a feeling of entertainment mixed with thoughtful reflection on the absurdities of modern life  kevin james irregardless transcript\\u266a ive been having dreams about falling in love \\u266a\\u266a it feels so real \\u266a\\u266a but nobody is here when i wake up

oh no which im told youre not supposed to do its like waking a sleepwalker youre not supposed to do that i put them on i wanted to see what he was doing you know what he was playing a game you know what game it was job simulator  he was working part time at a convenience store  he was waiting for customers to come in his store he was just sitting there  he wasnt active at all he wasnt sweeping up in between customers stacking cases of beer in the back he was sitting there he was sitting there and then finally a customer came in and he stepped up leveled up got him a pack of cigarettes or something rang him up i saw the cash register was right there gave him the change nodded hes a polite kid at least hes got that going for him then he goes back to his chair and im like what was this what was this and all that you know what it was he was scratching off his own lotto tickets  hes not even a good fake employee  i just said youre punished thats what it is thats whats up i dont know how to punish our kids anymore i dont even know what we can do what we cant do i dont even know what i know our parents our dads they knew how to punish back in the day they knew how to punish they did they had it exactly correct every the punishment always fit the crime perfectly because they got the belt thats whyyes you only had to get the belt once you got the belt once you never did whatever you were doing ever again then your dad just had to show you the belt and that was enough you remember that hey what did you say  yeah okay im goodyeah yes belt worked remember how out of nowhere that first time you got the belt was you were popping off at your mom you go like hey mom im not having your meatloaf tonight its horrible im not having it its very dry who puts peas in meatloaf i cant do it i cant its way too dry look up the recipe betty crocker check it out woman why is dad getting undressed whats going on what are you doing  no add ketchup to it i dont care some sauce get it going its just horrible its very dry whats up dad are you a lion tamer what is this whats this snap snap snap snap i dont know oh my god oh god  and it worked the belts worked since  bc its worked throughout history all the way up until like  when some frail dbag introduced the first time out  and thats when we lost society right there when everything burns and civilization comes to an end we can trace it all the way back to that one guy thats the guy time out it changed the game time out how can you do that can you imagine trying to convince your dad to give you a time out back in the day hey dad listen up very sorry about stealing your car last night taking it for a joy ride doing donuts in that parking lot and wiping out that whole store front but hows about this  instead of you whipping this ass with that leather strap and that massive belt buckle you got in new orleans  im thinking im gonna wander off over into the corner for a little bitmaybe think about where i went wrong maybe not i dont even know i dont know what im gonna do i might sing a song i might hum one it doesnt matter important thing is its my time its my time over in that corner and when i feel good enough and i feel like im ready to inject myself back into society i will come back here and i will tell you and well see how that goes how do you feel about that cowboy hows that  why are you getting undressed again whats going on  time out they dont even do time outs anymore now time outs are too cruel theyve become too cruel time outs oh the ch no you cant what you cant do a time out its too cruel for the child theyre alone theyre isolated theyre in the corner of the room by themselves there are other people theyre just no theyre way its in a corner theyre looking at two walls meeting its its too much for the child to deal with you cant isolate them like that any you cant you just cant isolate them they dont even do that anymore they dont do time outs anymore cause its too much they do whats called a time in its called a time in im serious what they do is the dad will take the child you sit in the middle of the room they put the child next to them they stroke their shoulder and you both kinda go over what went wrong and kinda where the child went off the tracks and once you start making them feel good about being bad  probably after like seven or eight minutes you just let them go then you stay there for like an additional four minutesjust to think about what a loser of a parent youve become  were raising baby veal thats what were doing we are we are we are were so easy on our kids and so what it doesnt help them i love my kids we all love our kids we know that but you know what they all cant be the best they cant not right away anyway this is what we tell them

know why cause we won thats it  you know how i know cause we kept score  you know why we did that cause thats how baseballs played the team with the larger number the more runs theyre the winners and the losers are the team with the less numbers theyre the losers and they go home as a team and they try to come back and do better and sometimes that drive actually helps them thats actually the better choice to lose and try to come back because its human naturehuman nature its good for them one trophy thats all i had i would go in my room and see that one trophy id be like oh yeah thats the year we won thats it the one time that was worth it it was great i went to my neighbors house his living room is littered with trophies i know his kids im like this is criminal  im like whats this one

fields i see them i see them here the pristine sod and the outfield walls with the sponsors and the and the lights for night games kidding me i played in the  and they had none of that you pull up to like a parking lot with cement and clumps of grass and broken schmidts bottles everywhere just is this field two yeah this is field two this is us your coach would pull up in a  impala pop the trunk to hand out uniforms  had everything in that trunk clearly thrown out of his house ten minutes ago by his wifesmoking right in front of us  gather round guys gather round team get around me make a circle listen to me if its a hit to right field shortstop got it covered second base dont overthrow the cutoff man okay youre overthrowing the like a nicotine oscillating fan right in our faces  no parents running over hey phil maybe you shouldnt smoke in front of the kids you kidding me theyre setting up snack tables playing dominoes drinking vodka about  yards that way  theyre just so happy the weird guy in the polyester pants and bushy mustache is looking after them for a while right in my face benson and hedges it stung right in the retinas stinging me like crazy smoke billowing down my body but you know what no allergies todaynada i eat whatever i want i can see a raccoon walking around midday just rip its face off clumps of hair missing doesnt matter i can just eat that thing whole and be fine an hour later  you know why cause i drank water out of a hose that was rolled up in my backyard  that sat outside in the grass in the hot sun for months at a time melting that plastic it boiled up so much it would burn your face it wouldnt even come out in a steady stream youd be ppppp  firing rusty spickets through that thing like bbs into the back of your throat until it wasnt enough and you just ripped the hose off the faucet and wrapped your lips around that  just suck all the asbestos and lead right out of the house just  go right to the source and i was fine why was i fine cause all day long at school im chewing on pencils  im sniffing magic markers like theyre going out of style thirty seconds a nostril have some fun get used to it eating paste cause it looked like mayonnaiseor playdoh how good did playdoh smell smelled amazing you try it like whoa different story  next day you try it again different color youre like maybe this is fruit flavored try  we had allergies and things back in the day we just didnt label everything im sure i had anxiety i know i did i was a pitcher i was eight years old i remember this i had a really strong arm i was on the mound i was firing the ball aiming it and i was missing the plate i started walking batters and it was getting to me i loaded up the bases and i was breathing heavy i felt it i felt this heaviness and it was bothering me i started trying harder and i was walking more batters i started walking runs in im looking at my friends in the field and they were looking at me and i felt terrible i remember this cause i remember my dad who was also a coach he walked out to the mound and he gave me the greatest advice ive ever received in my entire life he literally walked up to the mound he put both hands on my shoulder looked me dead in the eyes and says hey stop aiming the ball you know what to do he said two words just throw thats all he said just throw he turned around and he walked back to the dugout and i remember its the greatest advice ive ever received in my entire life think about it anytime life has got you down there are obstacles you gotta overcome just throw thats all you gotta do just throw yesbelieve in yourself trust yourself and just throw and thats what i did i launched back into my windup and i just threw and i shattered the kids cheekbone i remember  ball bounced like  yards two more runs scored so my dad was wrong there you gotta aim the ball  in baseball thats the thats like where thats the worst advice ever to just just throw it in baseball then youre just running around just throwing at everythingyou cant you gotta doesnt work in baseball but anywhere else in life its great advice great advise just throw just do it he was smart my dad was a smart man never went to college didnt have to didnt know all subjects but he knew subjects in depth he had depth to the subject that was it he knew it he knew it well i dont have that i dont know my dad was handing me the uh knowledge baton he was literally like here it is from generation to generation this is all the wisdom and intelligence of our family and im giving it to you my son and i was

fortytwo to one odds you have a good night sir have a good night sir  thats when my wife walked out of the bathroom what did i miss anything good haha okay all right my wifes awesome i love her so much she were an amazing fit because she loves to talk shes like the balance to me shes so good at it she can talk to people she knows what questions to ask she just loves it i remember that night we got in the car to drive home she just started talking again i was like hey you know we dont need it now wewe dont need to talk ever again  we dont thats a good thing weve been together like  years ive already said every word im ever gonna say to her in every combination thats it and she said every word to me she knows everything about me i know everything about her we dont need to talk anymore we can finish out the rest of our life with gestures thats it  not her she loves to talk she loves it shes just one of those people she just loves it loves the sound of her internal voice shes like uh loves the vibration of her lips on her teeth or something the whole nine yards whatevers involved with talking she  ever hear a baby whenever they find their voice theyre mamamama brr brr brr lala brr she just goes i dont think shes ever had an unexpressed thought in her lifeno everything she sees it goes right in and she has to say it she just oh my gosh this doors so squeaky that pictures crooked i cant believe that were gonna make eggplant for thursday well have some friends over would that be good look at my reflection in the mirror i see two of me do you see two of me its really weird i cant believe the kids are standing on hardwood floor now look at that the lights are good the holidays are coming this is fun hey sit one out sit one out  i have thoughts in my head all day long weird ones how many tater tots can i fit in my mouth without dropping any  its in there but i keep it in the barn i keep it in there not my wife she doesnt have any barn doors its just freerange thoughts i see it i say it i see it in the senses and i say it look at those exit signs the light the floor everything is i see it i say it i see it i say it its like a verbal wood chipper i see it i say it i gotta say it when i see it i see it i say it i gotta say it   hey theres an ebb and flow to conversations there is fifty percent is listening its like double dutch you gotta wait for your turn  not her shes in there the whole time like i got this this is my talk this is my talk back it off can someone else talk get outta here  this is me big mac filletofish quarter pounder french fries i see coke milkshake sundaes and apple pie  you wanna talk talk go in your closet take your clothes off and talk all night long but why do i have to be there  its this emotional backboard she doesnt care what i think or say she wants me there why talk go i always gotta be there though im literally brushing my teeth getting ready for bed and i hear it  telling me things that i experienced with her i was with her all day  cant believe alan stood up in front of everybody revealing facts about his son i didnt like that at all i couldnt believe it could you believe it in my head im going yes i can you know why cause i was there  this was your point of view  this was mine i was there i experienced everything with you nanananana talking herself to sleep literally talking herself through sleep you know how much you wanna go to sleep and youre tired and shes still fighting it    finally it goes quiet sweet quiet you go to bed next morning i wake up  im brushing my teeth and it starts up again in the other room  im like what new knowledge did you pick upovernight what did you get what could you have picked up nothing new happened  but she wants me there she wants me in that conversation again doesnt care about what i have to say does doesnt matter she wants me there and she tries to get me snagged into these conversations shell like lob out half sentences to me thats what shell do shell lob them out like she fly fishing to try to catch me  i sure hope ellens gonna be okay  i usually let the first one just pass by  cause if enough time passes i can just kinda   but theres always a followup sure hope they can work through this okay we gotta engage  im thinking whats our plan our plan is we wanna get outta here as quickly as possible we have so much stuff to do but we cant try to shorten the conversation we know that cause shell sense that shes good at that and then shell tack on  minutes just out of spite so  what if i steer into it what if i go in the other way its dangerous but its risky move but it could pay off lets just go into it and i did it hey honey yeah lets do it lets do what lets just talk about helen all morning long  lets just do it well grab a couple of beanbag chairs put on a pot of coffee well sit down you tell me everything about helen from conception to this morning  lets do it lets just get kneedeep in helen what do you say okay first of all its
